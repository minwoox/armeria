# Welcome to Armeria

_Armeria_ is an open-source asynchronous [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/) RPC/REST client/server library
built on top of [Java](https://go.java/), [Netty](https://netty.io/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/)
and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). Its primary goal is to help engineers build high-performance asynchronous
microservices that use HTTP/2 as a session layer protocol.

It is open-sourced and licensed under [Apache License 2.0](<https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)>)
by [LINE Corporation](https://linecorp.com/en/), who uses it in production.

## Features

### HTTP/2

- Supports HTTP/2 on both TLS and cleartext connections
- Supports protocol upgrade via both HTTP/2 connection preface and traditional HTTP/1 upgrade request
- Fully compatible with existing HTTP/1 servers
- Integrated PROXY protocol support for interoperability with load balancers such as HAProxy and AWS ELB.

### Integration with gRPC and Thrift

- Your gRPC or Thrift service implementation runs on top of Armeria without any modification.
- Works with the official gRPC or Thrift-over-HTTP client
- Works with the code generated by the official Protobuf or Thrift IDL compiler
- Supports various protocol combinations, such as:
  - gRPC-over-HTTP/1 & 2
  - Thrift-over-HTTP/1 & 2
  - gRPC-Web
- See Running a Thrift service and Running a gRPC service.

### Essential features for building microservices

- Metrics
- Circuit breaker
- Client-side health-check and load-balancing
- Service discovery from various sources such as DNS and ZooKeeper
  - See Client-side load balancing and service discovery.
- Distributed call tracing via Zipkin

### Interactive web-based debug console

- Browse the list of available RPC operations
- Invoke an RPC operation via a web form
- Share an RPC request with your colleagues so they can reproduce the problem easily
  - Just like sharing a cURL command, but works for RPC
- See Browsing and invoking services with DocService.

### Completely asynchronous and reactive

- Built on top of Reactive Streams and Java 8 CompletableFuture
- Asynchronous connection pool ensures your application never blocks even on pool exhaustion.
- Domain name lookups are also fully asynchronous thanks to Nettyâ€™s asynchronous domain name resolver.

### Compatibility with existing Java EE web applications

- Runs any Java EE web applications such as Spring Boot on the same TCP/IP port
- Your Java EE web application speaks HTTP/2!
- See Embedding a servlet container.

### Even higher performance on Linux

- JNI-based socket I/O
- BoringSSL-based TLS connections
